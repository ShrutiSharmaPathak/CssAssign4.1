selector nesting is applied in the following code.This removes the need for classes or IDs on 
<ul> and <li>.Following code means-
Background color of 3rd child (<li>) of <ul> inside  class "third" is set to blue.

/*
 nth-child pseudo-class allows to target one or more specific children of a given parent element.
 In above code  pseudo class is targeting the 3rd <li> of the parent <ul>.
 The style rules in the example above set the background color blue to only 3rd <li> element, without adding 
 any IDs or classes to the <li> elements. */
